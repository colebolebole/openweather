# Setup - GUI


Simply use any webserver client (exp SiPyWeb) also works on nginx, run it and it should work. already has a free public API key installed!
and/or you can of course make your own api key: https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys
If you are running on nginx Windows, just download our zip file from releases, extract it, and run nginx.exe!
