and you are done!

# Setup - GUI
1. Choose Your Web Server:

Flexibility: You have the freedom to use various web server clients, including SiPyWeb and nginx.
nginx on Windows: If you're using nginx on Windows, simply download the zip file from the releases, extract it, and run nginx.exe. It's that easy!

2. Start the Server:

No extra steps: Once you've chosen your web server, just fire it up and you're ready to go.
API Key:

Free public key: A free public API key is conveniently pre-installed, so you can start using the service right away.
Customization: If you prefer to use your own API key, you can easily create one at [openweathermap.org/appid](https://openweathermap.org/appid)
That's it! With these simple steps, you'll be up and running in no time.

# Don't want to use an API Key?
